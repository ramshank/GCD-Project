The tidy data has summarized values for each of the subject's activity against the key measures.

Each Column indicates the activity and the subject in the form <activity>.<subject> 

for example Column name LAYING.1 indicates activity LAYING for subject 1
Each row then represents the summararized averages for each measure recorded from the orignal dataset

Data can be found for the following measures
BodyAccXMean - Average Body accelration along X axis
BodyAccSdX - Standard Deviation of the body accelration along X axis
BodyAccYMean - Average Body Acceleration along Y axis
BodyAccSdY - Standard Deviation of Body Acceleration along Y axis
BodyAccZMean - Average Body Acceleration along Z axis
BodyAccSdZ - Standard Deviation of Body Acceleration along Z axis
BodyGyroXMean - Average Triaxial Angular Velocity along X axis
BodyGyroSdX- Standard Deviation of Triaxial Angular Velocity along X axis
BodyGyroYMean - Average Triaxial Angular Velocity along Y Axis
BodyGyroSdY- Standard Deviation of Triaxial Angular Velocity along Y axis
BodyGyroZMean - Average Triaxial Angular Velocity along Z axis
BodyGyroSdZ- Standard Deviation of Triaxial Angular Velocity along Z axis
totalAccXMean - Average Total accelration along X axis
totalAccSdX - Standard Deviation of the Total accelration along X axis
totalAccYMean - Average Total accelration along Y axis
totalAccSdY- Standard Deviation of the Total accelration along Y axis
totalAccZMean - Average Total accelration along Z axis
totalAccSdZ- Standard Deviation of the Total accelration along Z axis
